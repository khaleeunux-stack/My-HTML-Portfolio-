<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>Hi, I’m Ibrahim Khalil Yunus,  22-year-old web developer and graphic designer with a passion for creating modern, functional, and visually engaging digital experiences. </p>
<p>I studied Political Science at Gombe State University, which helped sharpen my analytical and problem-solving skills—tools I now apply in building effective web solutions and design projects.</p>

<p>My educational journey began at Darul Arqam Academy Gombe, where I completed both my primary and secondary education. Since then, I’ve developed strong expertise in frontend development, UI/UX design, and branding, blending creativity with code to deliver value-driven results for clients and teams.</p>

<p>I’m constantly learning, growing, and pushing my skills forward—one pixel and one line of code at a time.</p>
